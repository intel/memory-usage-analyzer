## Prepare the example workload
This is prerequisite  for all the examples. This example workload prepares a large memory segment. A portion of this memory segment is accessed (50% or 75% of the total) to create the memory regions which are the more frequently accessed (hot) and less frequently accessed (cold).
```shell
cd tests/example
make
./workload
# Sample output
usage ./workload: total_memory(GiB) hot_timer loops
```

The parameters:
* `total_memory` : amount of memory used by the workload in GiB
* `hot_timer` : time period spend in 50% and 75% hot memory modes in seconds
* `loops` : controls the amount of work done, if 0 the workload runs forever

Here's an example run of the workload:
```shell

./workload 8 10 1000
# Sample output
[INFO] (main:34) : pid       = 20141
[INFO] (main:35) : memory    = 8 GiB = 2097152 pages
[INFO] (main:36) : hot timer = 10 sec
[INFO] (main:37) : loops     = 1000
[INFO] (main:51) : Done with setup in 3 seconds.
[INFO] (sigalrm_handler:17) : hot pages = 75%
[INFO] (sigalrm_handler:17) : hot pages = 50%
[INFO] (main:68) : Done with test in 21 seconds.
```

## Profile the Example Workload
There are three different scenarios that are provided here. Please make sure that [Prepare the example workload](#Prepare-the-example-workload) steps are complete.

1. Baseline - Running baseline without any memory pressure and collecting the memory usage statistics
1. Dynamic Squeezer - Running workload under a Cgroup to create memory pressure,  where the memory limit is adjusted dynamically to limit the page fault rate
1. Static Squeezer - Running workload under a Cgroup to create memory pressure, where the memory limit to fixed 

### Simple Workload - Baseline

This is an example of running baseline workload. Before running the workload, system configuration should be performed to enable the data collection.
For system configuration details, please refer [config](../../docs/README.md)

```shell
cd tests/example
# Configure the system for data collection
config.py
# Configuration ZSWAP compressor
zswapcompconfig.py -c lzo-rle
memory_usage_analyzer.py ./workload 8 60 10000

###  Example Workload with dynamic squeezer
This is an example where dynamic memory-limit is applied to workload through cgroup with page-fault rate as the metric. The memory limit is applied gradually to the workload till the page-fault-rate reaches the threshold. After that, dynamic squeezer adjusts the memory limit to keep the page-fault-rate within the threshold by relaxing the memory-limit.
Please refer to the config file for dynamic squeezer in the repo memory-usage-analyzer/src/reclaimer/

A memory usage report is generated after the profiling runs are complete.
The default results path is profile* and we can also override the default path using the -o option.

###  Example Workload with static squeezer
This is an example where static  memory-limit is applied to workload through cgroup. The fixed memory limit on Cgroup can be a percentage of the maximum baseline memory usage.

Please refer to the static squeezer config file in  memory-usage-analyzer/src/reclaimer/squeezerstaticconfig.json. In this example, there are multiple runs - baseline runs followed by memory-limit runs with memory-limit set as 2%, 4%, 8% and 16% of the maximum baseline memory usage.

cd tests/example

#### Visualizations
There are multiple directories that are created for each memory-limit runs. Here is one example from 8% memory-limit run.

![Memoryusage](ref_results/Staticmemoryusage.png "MemoryUsage")
![Memorypressure](ref_results/Staticmemorypressure.png "Memorypressure")
![Pagefaultrate](ref_results/StaticpageFaultrate.png "Pagefaultrate")

A memory usage report is generated after the profiling runs are complete.
The default results path is profile* and we can also override the default path using the -o option.
